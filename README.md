Added sounds are stored in $HOME/.config/timer/sounds directory on Linux 
and %HOME%\AppData\timer\sounds on Windows. Name of the file is the name of the sound.

Time value is of the format 1h20m30s. Some valid examples are:
	2h          time of 2 hours
	1h5m        time of 1 hour 5 minutes

By default the audacious will be used to pla the sound. The default command is:
	audacious -H -q FILE

where FILE is the location of the audio file.

A custom command can be set via the environment variable TIMER_SOUND_CMD.

Examples:
	$ # set custom sound command to ffplay
	$ export TIMER_SOUND_CMD="ffplay -nodisp -autoexit -i FILE -hide_banner -loglevel panic"
	$ # start a timer of 30 minutes
	$ timer -t 30m
	$ # start a timer of 3 minutes 101 seconds
	$ timer -t 3m101s

	$ # start a timer and play sound when expired and show notification
	$ timer -t 30m -s Alien -notify
	$ # listen to a sound
